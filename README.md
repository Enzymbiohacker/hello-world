Enzyme-biohacker
I am a mechanic that is also a biohacker that creates enzymes or proteins that change RNA/DNA codes to improve my body like faster healing, lower colestoral ect...using nanomaterials as a base exciter to grow the proteins. and am needing to create a system to guide me throught the different transmission metals for specific cellular structure manipulations. for inorganic enzymes/proteins.
